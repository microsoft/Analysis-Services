## For a detailed list of features and use cases, please refer to the ALM Toolkit [documentation](Semantic%20Model%20Comparison%20and%20Merging%20with%20ALM%20Toolkit.pdf)

The ALM Toolkit is a schema comparison tool for Power BI semantic models that enables scenarios such as:

* Easily deploy changes only to model metadata, whilst retaining data including incremental refresh data.
* Diff & merge across models/repos with guardrails to ensure the integrity of the resulting model metadata. Pick and choose objects to reuse in other models.
* Reuse common objects across models. For example, conformed dimensions, standardized date dimensions, and common measures to be standardized across models.
* Command-line execution for automation.

ALM Toolkit supports the Tabular Model Definition Language (TMDL) format to view semantic model metadata in a human-readable, YAML-like syntax. See the TMDL [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/analysis-services/tmdl/tmdl-overview) page for more information.

Download and try out the [latest release](/../../releases/latest) of ALM Toolkit to manage your Power BI semantic models.
